# SRT Subtitle Generator using Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) & PyQt6

This application provides a graphical interface to generate SRT subtitle files from an audio file and a script using Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA). 
It supports both short and long video formats with configurable subtitle length.

---

## 🔧 Basic Implementation

### Workflow:
1. **User Input**: Upload an audio file (WAV/MP3) and its corresponding script (TXT).
2. **MFA Alignment**:
   - Uses a pretrained acoustic model and optionally a pronunciation dictionary.
   - Aligns audio with the script and produces a TextGrid file.
3. **Post-Processing**:
   - Parses the TextGrid file to extract word-level timestamps.
   - Re-injects original casing and punctuation from the script.
   - Groups words into sentences for subtitle lines.
   - Converts them to standard `.srt` format.
4. **GUI**:
   - Built with PyQt6 for user-friendly interaction.
   - Logs progress and prompts for SRT file saving location.

## 📦 Environment Setup

### 1. Install Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA)

Create a dedicated environment using Conda for MFA:

```bash
conda env create -f mfa_env.yml
conda activate mfa_env
```

### 2. Install GUI dependencies (PyQt6)

Install PyQt6 and related packages in a separate or the same environment:

```bash
pip install PyQt6==6.7.1
```

## 📥 Notes

- Ensure `mfa` CLI is available in your `PATH` (after installing via conda).
- If not using a dictionary, modify the `generate_subtitles` function and remove the `dictionary_path` argument.
- This project supports dictionary-free alignment using `--use_g2p True`.
